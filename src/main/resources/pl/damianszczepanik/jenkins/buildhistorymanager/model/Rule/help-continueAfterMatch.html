<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>Decides whether next rules should validate current build when this rule matches the build.</p>

<p><b>Use cases</b></p>
<p>This is the way to configure if it is enough to match only at once condition or there should be matched more.
    When this parameter is set to <code>true</code> then there is logical <code>and</code> condition between current and
    next condition so all must match.</p>

<p><b>Warning!</b></p>
<p>This rule is validated against rule per each build.</p>
