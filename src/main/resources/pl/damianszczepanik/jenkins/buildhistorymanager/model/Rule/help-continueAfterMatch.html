<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>
    By default, after the conditions of a rule are met and the action are apllied,
    the plugin moves on to the next completed build in the build history and
    starts to process all the rules again from the start of the list of rules.
</p>
<p>
    When this flag is set to <code>false</code> (default) AND this rule's conditions are met,
    this rule is the last rule applied to the build. The plugin moves on to the next completed build
    and starts processing the rules from the start of the list of rules.
</p>
<p>
    When this flag is set to <code>true</code> AND this rule's conditions are met,
    the plugin moves on to the next rule with the same build. This way multiple consecutive rules
    can be applied to the same build.
</p>

<p><b>Use cases</b></p>
<p>
    This is the way to apply more than one rule to the same build, providing the conditions of all those rules are met.
