<ul>
    <li>
        When this flag is set to <code>false</code>,
        AND the conditions of this rule are met,
        this rule will be the final rule applied to the build,
        the plugin stops applying rules to this build,
        and goes to the next iteration of the "for each completed build" loop.</li>
    <li>
        When this flag is set to <code>true</code> (which is the default),
        AND the conditions of this rule are met,
        the next rule is applied to the same build,
        and goes to the next iteration of the "for each rule" loop.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Use cases</b></p>
<p>
    This feature allows for the application of multiple consecutive rules to the same build, as long as the conditions for each of those rules are met.
