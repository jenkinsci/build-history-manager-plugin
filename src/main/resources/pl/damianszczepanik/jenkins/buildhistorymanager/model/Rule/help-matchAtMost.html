<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>The rule will stop being processed after a certain number of matched builds.
    Once this condition is met, only the other rules will continue to be processed..</p>

<p><b>Use cases</b></p>
<p>This feature provides the option to control the number of changes executed by a specific rule, which can significantly save time for longer build histories.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the value is set to <code>-1</code>, there is no limitation, all builds will be evaluated</li>
    <li>If the value is set to <code>0</code>, no builds will be evaluated. This is useful when it's simpler to match builds that shouldn't be deleted and skip them from evaluation.</li>
    <li>If the value is set to <code>1..n</code> Once the value is reached, the rule is effectively disabled and is no longer applied.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Warning!</b></p>
<p>If the `matchAtMost` value is set to zero,the rule is effectively disabled. This is useful if the user wants to disable a rule while keeping its other configuration values.</p>
