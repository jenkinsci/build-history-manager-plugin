<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>The rule will stop being processed after a certain number of matched builds.
    Once this condition is met, only the other rules will continue to be processed.</p>

<p><b>Use cases</b></p>
<p>This feature provides the option to control the number of builds the rule can process. It may save a significant amount of time when the build history is long.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the value is set to <code>-1</code>, there is no limitation, all builds will be evaluated.</li>
    <li>If the value is set to <code>0</code>, no builds will be evaluated. This disables the rule as it will not apply to any build.</li>
    <li>If the value is set to <code>1..n</code>, once the value is reached, the rule is effectively disabled and is no longer applied.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Warning!</b></p>
<p>If the <code>matchAtMost</code> value is set to zero, the rule is effectively disabled. This is useful if the user wants to disable a rule while keeping its other configuration values.</p>
