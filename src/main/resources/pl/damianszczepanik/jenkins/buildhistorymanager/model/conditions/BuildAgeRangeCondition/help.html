<h3>Description</h3>
Matches builds that age is between given days range. It calculates days only without checking build time.

<h3>Use cases</h3>
Allow to match several builds at once based on build age.

<h3>Warning!</h3>
Time of the build completed is reset to zero before comparison so only days are compared.
<code>maxDaysAge = 0</code> refers to builds which were completed today
<code>1-2</code> means builds which were completed yesterday or the day before yesterday.<br>

Build completed time (age) is calculated as sum of <code><a
    href="https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/Run.html#getStartTimeInMillis--">getStartTimeInMillis()</a></code> and
<code><a
    href="https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/Run.html#getDuration--">getDuration()</a></code>.
