<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>Matches builds that age is between given days range. It calculates days only without checking build time.</p>

<p><b>Use cases</b></p>
<p>Allow to match several builds at once based on build age.</p>

<p><b>Warning!</b></p>
<p>Provided values are always relative to <i>today</i> so most likely they interact with different builds every
    day.<br/>
    Time of the build completed is reset to zero before comparison so only days are compared.</p>
<code>maxDaysAge = 0</code> refers to builds which were completed today<br/>
<code>1-2</code> means builds which were completed yesterday or the day before yesterday.<br/>

<p>Build completed time (age) is calculated as sum of <code>
    <a href="https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/Run.html#getStartTimeInMillis--">getStartTimeInMillis()</a></code>
    and
    <code><a href="https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/Run.html#getDuration--">getDuration()</a></code>.</p>
