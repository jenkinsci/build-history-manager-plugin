<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>Deletes build artifacts that match the Ant-style glob patterns provided.</p>
<p><b>Include Patterns</b></p>
<p>The include pattern is a comma-separated list of Ant-style globs that follows a specific format.
    The path separator for this format is the forward slash (/) and an empty string is used in the include pattern to indicate that there are no matches.
    If the goal is to match everything except for certain files (defined as "Exclude Patterns"), then the recommended approach is to use the value <code>**</code> here and call out exclusions below.</p>
<p><b>Exclude Patterns</b></p>
<p>The exclude pattern is an optional input that should be in the same format as the include pattern.</p>
<p><b>Use cases</b></p>
<p>To delete artifacts with a specific file extension, for example use the include pattern "**/*.log" to delete all the log files.</p>
<p>To keep artifacts with a specific file extension, for example use the exclude pattern "**/*.log" to delete everything except the log files.</p>

<p><b>Warning!</b></p>
<p>It is important to note that this feature should be used with caution as it can be permanently
    delete artifacts that may be important for later reference or analysis. It is recommended that users
    carefully review the pattern and build history before executing the deletion.</p>
